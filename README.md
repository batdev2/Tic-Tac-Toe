# Tic-Tac-Toe
A C++ game of Tic Tac Toe in which 2 players play against each other. The program will detect if there are any matching pairs of 3 (either of 'x' or '0') and will show who won. This project shows my ability to work with functions and how to use header files. 
Also I use a second .cpp file in order to define my functions.
